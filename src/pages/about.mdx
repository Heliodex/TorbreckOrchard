# Our Story

We are an independent, family-run heritage fruit tree orchard.

Kay and Des Kelly commenced fruit tree planting in 2009 with the intention of creating an orchard which would preserve some of Scotland's rarest heirloom apple varieties. Today, Torbreck Orchard hosts a collection of over 200 different heritage varieties of apples, pears and plums...

...all grown without the use of pesticides, insecticides, herbicides or fungicides.

Instead, we draw on a wealth of knowledge, combined with all of our dedication and hard work.
